- 👋 Hi, I’m @sjm537
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and computer programming, especially in combination with each other.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, in addition to continued work on HTML/CSS/Javascript. Check out my basic python projects repository to see what I'm practicing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that will help me get used to working within GitHub. I've had this account for well over a year and have used it periodically for various purposes, but I want to get to a point where using GitHub is second nature.
- 📫 Contact me on Twitter @sjmiller537
