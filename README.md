- 👋 Hi, I’m @sjm537
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and computer programming, specifically the intersection between the two.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, in addition to continued work on HTML/CSS/Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that will help me get used to working within GitHub. I've had this account for well over a year, but still don't feel as comfortable moving around the platform as I need to be!
- 📫 Contact me on Twitter @sjmiller537
